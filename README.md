This README is structured in clean Markdown, ready for you to copy and paste directly into your GitHub repository or project documentation. I’ve updated the formatting for better readability and added a section on Analytical Insights to give it a more professional "research project" feel.PDF Estimation & Non-Linear Transformation ProjectProject OverviewThis project explores non-linear data modeling and probability density function (PDF) estimation using Air Quality data ($NO_2$). By applying a student-specific transformation to raw sensor data, we simulate complex environmental noise and then reconstruct the statistical profile using the Method of Moments.1. MethodologyThe implementation is broken down into two distinct phases:Phase I: Non-Linear Data TransformationTo create a unique dataset, the original feature $x$ (Air Quality Index for $NO_2$) is mapped to a transformed variable $z$. This transformation introduces non-linearity based on parameters derived from the user's Roll Number ($r$).Transformation Formula:$$z = x + a_r \sin(b_r x)$$Parameter Logic:$a_r = 0.05 \times (r \pmod 7)$ (Amplitude of perturbation)$b_r = 0.3 \times (r \pmod 5 + 1)$ (Frequency of perturbation)Phase II: PDF Learning (Parameter Estimation)The distribution of the transformed variable $z$ is modeled using a Gaussian-style density function:$$\hat{p}(z) = c \cdot e^{-\lambda(z - \mu)^2}$$We "learn" the distribution by matching the moments of the dataset:$\mu$ (Location): The sample mean of the transformed data.$\lambda$ (Scale): Defined as $1/(2\sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^2$ is the sample variance.$c$ (Normalization): Ensures the integral of the PDF equals 1, calculated as $\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}$.2. Quantitative ResultsUsing the Roll Number 102317254, the following parameters were derived and learned during the execution:ParameterLogic / SourceCalculated ValueRoll Number ($r$)Input102317254$a_r$$0.05 \times (r \pmod 7)$0.10$b_r$$0.3 \times (r \pmod 5 + 1)$1.50$\mu$ (Learned)np.mean(z)25.816375$\lambda$ (Learned)$1 / (2 \cdot Var(z))$0.001461$c$ (Learned)$1 / (\sigma\sqrt{2\pi})$0.0215693. VisualizationThe project generates a visual comparison between the transformed data histogram and the learned PDF curve to validate the estimation accuracy.Note: The proximity of the curve to the histogram bars indicates the effectiveness of the Method of Moments in capturing the central tendency and spread of the transformed Air Quality data.4. Key FindingsRobustness: The Gaussian approximation remains a strong baseline even after non-linear sine-wave perturbations.Sensitivity: Small changes in $a_r$ significantly impact the "jaggedness" of the distribution, while $b_r$ affects the local variance.
